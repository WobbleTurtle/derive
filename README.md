## Site #1: Municipal World’s Website

<b>•What is the URL?</b>

https://www.municipalworld.com/

<b>•How did you get there?</b>

I got there using the Google Search Engine. I used to work there as a Management Assistant, so I was familiar with the site before I started this project; simply looking for the site on Google was quick and easy to do. I should also mention that this is Municipal World’s recent rebranding that they did about a year and a half ago, so this site is a complete overhaul from their previous version. 

<b>•How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?</b>

As mentioned before, this site had a recent redesign and it is now pretty current in design trends; its formatted for people who are familiar with scrolling and the layout works well with mobile. The information, when scrolling, is divided into separate rows with easy to read text sizes for quick viewing. The colour palette is simplistic: Featuring white and blue colours as its main scheme, but then incorporating red and green accent colours when needed to allow the user’s eye to be drawn to important information but not get overwhelmed. Overall, this website’s design is pretty common, but useful and easy to navigate for Municipal World Magazine’s older audiences. 

<b>•Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?</b>

Again, as its part of the overall design, the navigation system of this website is pretty common. Its a simple header with navigation buttons that are separated by rows to make the website look less cluttered and easy to view (therefore making it easy to find things). 

<b>•What parts of the site are interactive?</b>

The navigation buttons, the header, the contact us page, the page to order supplies, as well as the form to fill out to subscribe to the magazine are all interactive. That’s really about it. 

<b>•How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?</b>

I personally feel that this site is a little plain, but it is much more mature and seamless in comparison to Municipal World’s previous site. Before, the navigation system consisted of a header and you had to call in order to buy or request any information about any of Municipal World’s supplies. Also, they used to have a purple and black colour scheme which looked off for their general audience. The site now, while modern, is simply basic and does what it needs to do and, for a small but well-off company, sometimes that’s all you really need. 

<b>•What is one thing you would change about this site?</b>

Bring in more interactive elements. I would love to incorporate an interactive magazine on the site where you can physically click through articles and watch the site flip through pages of an older issue of their magazine. Also, the company itself is very nervous about using videos. I attempted to suggest better video marketing and demos that could be incorporated into their site during my time there (typically with motion graphics), but I was only seen as a young naïve student at the time and thus ignored. For me, simply putting a video at the top of the site to introduce people to the site could make a big difference.  It would also be cool to include an interactive timeline from when Municipal World started back in 1981 to present day. I got to search through their achieves and frame older magazines across their hallways when I worked there, and I would love it if they decided to incorporate it in a digital context.

## Site #2: The Property of Hate

<b>•What is the URL?</b>

http://thepropertyofhate.com/

<b>•How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?</b>

I’m a fan of the artist who runs and owns the comic site, so I just searched them and found their site through a link on their Twitter. 

<b>•How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?</b>

It’s a little dated, reminiscent of the times of msn chatrooms and text-based websites, but the way its designed makes it feel timeless in the since of the art used to push the ideas forward. The header and side panels are actually part of the navigation system, which allows the information to be compact but still readable. The little sprites when moving your cursor over the buttons makes it unique and memorable too.  

<b>•Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?</b>

I kind of mentioned the navigation system in the previous question. It’s the navigation system that makes the design memorable so I don’t think I can really add more to this.

<b>•What parts of the site are interactive?</b>

The buttons. The navigation system. You can click side panels to go to different sites to support the artist. 

<b>•How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?</b>

I wouldn’t say that its beautiful, but because the artist and I have spoken before (they even drew something for me a while back!) their site is really relaxing to be on. 

<b>•What is one thing you would change about this site?</b>

Maybe the font choices and the colors that the side panels change into when you move the cursor over them- the bright blue can make it hard to read the text.

## Site #3: Climber

•What is the URL?

http://www.climber.io/

•How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?

I googled ‘Cool interactive websites’ on Google and found it in a list of websites. I was running out of ideas! 

•How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?

I’ve never seen a site designed like this before, it is very unique! The transitions between pages are what make this site stand out from the rest. Its design seems to work best for mobile, specifically tablets, as you have to constantly scroll between panels to get more information. It would be much easier to flick through the pages with a hand rather than a mouse. 

•Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?

The navigation appears to be uniquely designed movable buttons that spine and twist when you move your cursor over them. The basic concept is familiar, but its execution is uncommon in the sense that the buttons constantly move as you switch through the different parts of the site. Also the transitions in the beginning make the navigation system very memorable. 

•What parts of the site are interactive?

The movement of the site's buttons itself is very interactive. 

•How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

Its very pretty, but not very useful. You frequently have to scroll or click something in order to get the simplest information. Its tedious on a desktop but perfect for mobile. 

•What is one thing you would change about this site?

Keep the transitions but slow down movement for the text for readability. Also streamline it to work better with a mouse so people aren’t constantly scrolling to get little bits of information.

## Site #4: The Evolution of Trust

•What is the URL?

https://ncase.me/trust/

•How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?

I actually found it one day while scrolling through Tumblr! Its an interesting game that goes in depth with a theory why there’s been an increase of distrust in the past few decades. It’s a pretty fun and interesting game!

•How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?

It’s a very interactive website with a lot of motion. Its timeless in the fact that its cartoon characters are simple (tying in with the idea of designing the human figure in its most basic form). The simple quiet music acts as an ambiance and is not meant to be trendy or current with the times and just help the player focus when they are playing the game. Its simple white background with dark header allows the viewer to focus on the main content (i.e. The game) and the layout gives way to a clean simple design. 

•Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?

There is a footer at the bottom of the game that allows the user to go back a few pages to reread information and there are a few translations of the game in small font in case of language barriers. So, its simple and easy to access for anyone around the world. 

•What parts of the site are interactive?

The game itself and the buttons containing footnotes that are scattered throughout the game are all interactive. 

•How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

Its interesting and engaging but not necessarily beautiful. Its simplistic which allows the point of the game to be the site’s main focus. 

•What is one thing you would change about this site?

Better navigation to go back to the main page. This is only one game that the creator developed and they have a full list of games that you can access via their main page… but the only way you can do that is by editing the url directly or searching for the site on google.

## Site #5: Paletton 

•What is the URL?

http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

•How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?

One of my other teachers recommended the site to me when trying to figure out colour palettes. I’ve used it as a reference ever since. 

•How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?

Its pretty basic, reminiscent of a phone app. It features a simple colour wheel and a few buttons to choose between different colour palettes and exporting features. It’s a little dated as its run and maintained by someone as a hobby and relies on a lot of ads on the sides for revenue. 

•Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?

The navigation, like the rest of the site, is pretty simple: just a few buttons to edit your settings to pick your colors or choose color palettes

•What parts of the site are interactive?

The colour wheel itself is as are the exporting buttons for your colour palettes. 

•How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

Its useful, not really interesting or beautiful, but very useful. I used it a lot when I was first starting out, but now I only use it for fun or when I’m really stuck on a project. 

•What is one thing you would change about this site?

Make the text bigger so that it can read better.
